### Convolutional nerual network

## Computer Vision
Facial Recogonition. Input: Image, Output: emotions, key features.
Self-Driving cars

## Feature extraction
High level features: noses, wheels
Low level features: line, shape, grayness

## Manual Feature Extraction
Domain Knowledge, Define features, Detect features to classify.

## Fully Connected Neural Network
Fully connected: each input is connected to each output.
Input: 2D image, vector of pixel values
Lost of spatial knowledge, if we just put in
Create patches for spatial information
## Apply filter on the patches to get Feature map
dot product of patch and filter. This extract local features. 

## Why is it called Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
Convolutional operation,

## Maxpool patch
Take the maximum in the patch
Decrease input size. 

## Layer to get hierachy of features

## CNN classification
Input-> Conv low level + activation -> pooling -> conv high level + activationg -> classification -> flatten -> softmax

## CNN powers
Change output easily 
## What if we
